  summary:
    "In late 2022, I embarked on my journey in higher education by [enrolling in a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science](/#education). My passion for theoretical computer science was ignited in Spring 2024, when I took [Jo√£o Ribeiro](https://sites.google.com/site/joaorib94/)'s exceptional course in Theory of Computation. This course deepened my interest in theoretical computer science with a particular emphasis on complexity theory, cryptography, and pseudorandomness, leading me to dedicate significant time and effort to further study these subjects. Since then, I have dedicated myself to further studying these subjects. In parallel with my academic pursuits, I co-founded a startup called S&X in 2024 with a colleague, leveraging our combined skills and knowledge to drive innovative solutions in the tech industry.",
